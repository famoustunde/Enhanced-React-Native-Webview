# Enhanced-React-Native-Webview
Simple react native webview app with auto height and back button control.

I would like to share this with you, a work I made based on Kyle Bremner's and Patrick Galbraith's work, that could be found on the links below. 
This project is a React Native webview with an Auto height that has a back button, we could be used as a navigation tool to the previous screen within the WebView.
Hope this can help you in your work.

This project was made as a proof of concept for the beautiful and exceptional platform of a friend of mine. www.iwaria.com 

A Free African high quality photos stock platform for your projects.
